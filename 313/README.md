This week's question:

You have a faulty keyboard. Whenever you type a vowel on it (a,e,i,o,u,y), it reverses the string that you have written, instead of typing the character. Typing other characters works as expected. Given a string, return what will be on the screen after typing with your faulty keyboard.

Example:

> faultyKeeb('string')
> 'rtsng'

> faultyKeeb('hello world!')
> 'w hllrld!'
